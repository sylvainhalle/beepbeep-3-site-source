Extending BeepBeep
==================

[Home](index.html)

BeepBeep was designed from the start to be easily extensible. As was discussed earlier, it consists of only a small core of built-in processors and functions. The rest of its functionalities are implemented through custom processors and grammar extensions, grouped in packages called *palettes*.

- [Creating a Custom Processor](custom-processor.html)
- [Extending ESQL](extend-esql.html), BeepBeep's query language
- Wrapping it up: creating a palette (under construction)
