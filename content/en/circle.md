Circle
======

A circle is a simple shape in Euclidean geometry that is the set of all
points in a plane that are a given distance from a given point, the center.
The distance between any of the points and the center is called the radius.
A circle is therefrom defined as the curve traced out at the distance of the
radius so that any point along the curve is congruent to all other points
relative to the center. A circle might also be defined as a special ellipse
in which the two foci are coincident and the eccentricity is 0. As a planar
geometry, a circle conic section is formed when a right circular cone is
intersected by a plane perpendicular to the axis of the cone. Its topology
is defined as a simple closed curve which divides the plane into two
regions: an interior and an exterior. In everyday use, the term "circle" may
be used interchangeably to refer to either the boundary of the figure, or to
the whole figure including its interior; in strict technical usage, the
circle is the former and the latter is called a disk.
